Market Listings
-----------------

`draft` `optional` `author:braydonf`

This NIP defines a means to list goods and services for trade that can be paid for using NIP-57/Zaps (optionally).

The motivation is:
- Discover products and services that are near you. This can be in both physical space as well as social space using your follow graph.
- Producers can list goods and services and efficiently find customers.

Here is an example flow:
- Bob posts a market listing for a 1/8 of beef with a location and support ZIP-57 payments.
- Alice wants to find local ranchers near her that accept payment in Zaps.
- Alice uses a software client to view ranchers that are near her.
- Alice finds Bob's market listing for the 1/8 of beef.
- Alice zaps Bob for the 1/8 of beef.
- Bob's software client then creates a private direct message to Alice to complete the order with the necessary details including pickup or delivery.
